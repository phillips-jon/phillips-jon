Hey, I’m Jon.

I’ve been building on the web for a long time, mostly product work where design and code overlap.

### Projects
I build and ship projects across SaaS, content, and tooling.

- https://hprfcl.com  
  Easily create Lightroom and Photoshop ACR presets and LUTs from natural language and reference images.

- https://dailytips.dev  
  A 5-minute daily read on decisions, logic, distribution, and the thinking that turns code into products.

- https://autochangelog.com  
  Automatically generates clean, public changelogs from pull requests, code diffs, and commits.

- https://preflight.sh  
  A CLI that catches common misconfigurations and deployment issues before they go live.

- https://emailgrowthguide.com  
  The playbook for launching, growing, and monetizing your email newsletter.

- https://distributionkit.com  
  Launch smarter. 140+ platforms and directories to get your product in front of the right people.

- https://dailyphototips.com  
  Short, practical, and actionable photography tips delivered to your inbox daily.

- https://thedailypreset.com  
  One Lightroom preset delivered every weekday, built for real photos and real workflows.

Previously, I worked on monetization, infrastructure, and developer-facing tools at https://buysellads.com/ and https://fullres.com for 15 years.

### How I build
I don’t get attached to stacks, but I do care about shipping, maintainability, and not creating problems for future me.

I often work with Rails, Hotwire, Stimulus, Tailwind, Alpine, Craft CMS, React, Vite, and Next.js, plus whatever else fits the project.

The tech is a tool, the product is the point.

### Writing
I believe strongly in email and building audiences you can actually reach.

I write about building products, logic, UX, distributiuon, and long-term thinking at: https://joncphillips.com
