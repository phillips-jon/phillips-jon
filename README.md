Hey, I’m Jon.

I’ve been building on the web for a long time, mostly product work where design and code overlap.

### Day job
I work on monetization, infrastructure, and developer-facing tools at:

- https://buysellads.com  
  Advertising and monetization tools for modern publishers.

- https://fullres.com  
  Privacy-first analytics and optimization for ad-supported sites.

- https://ready.dev  
  Tools and infrastructure to help developers ship and run production apps.

### Projects
Outside of work, I build and ship projects across SaaS, content, and tooling.

- https://autochangelog.com  
  Automatically generates clean, public changelogs from pull requests and commits.

- https://preflight.sh  
  A CLI that catches common misconfigurations and deployment issues before they go live.

- https://dailyphototips.com  
  Short, practical photography tips delivered daily.

- https://thedailypreset.com  
  A Lightroom preset every weekday, built for real photos and real workflows.

### How I build
I don’t get attached to stacks, but I do care about shipping, maintainability, and not creating problems for future me.

I often work with Rails, Tailwind, Alpine, Hotwire, Stimulus, React, Vite, and Next.js, plus whatever else fits the project.

The tech is a tool. The product is the point.

### Writing
I believe strongly in email and building audiences you can actually reach.
